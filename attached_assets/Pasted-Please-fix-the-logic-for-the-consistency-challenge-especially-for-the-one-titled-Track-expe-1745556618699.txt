Please **fix the logic for the `consistency` challenge**, especially for the one titled: “Track expenses daily for 7 days”.

---

## 🚨 Current Problem:
- No progress is registered even when the user adds expenses.
- The system doesn’t track daily activity as it should.
- It also does not fail the challenge when a day is skipped.

## ✅ Required Behavior (Strict Mode)

### Challenge Name: “Track expenses daily for 7 days”
Type: `consistency`

---

### 📅 Challenge Rules:

1. The moment the user **starts the challenge**, a 7-day timer begins (e.g., April 25 → May 1).
2. During each of the 7 **consecutive calendar days**:
   - The user **must add at least one expense** per day.
   - If this is done → progress increases each day (1/7, 2/7, etc.).
3. If the user **fails to add an expense on any single day**, the challenge is **immediately failed**.
   - No grace period.
   - No retry within the same 7-day window.
4. Once 7 successful days are completed:
   - The challenge is automatically moved to **Completed**.
   - Removed from **Active**.

### ⏱️ Important Details:

- The day resets at midnight (use device local time or UTC consistently).
- Days must be **consecutive** — if a day is missed, the entire challenge fails.

---

### 👀 Additional Requirements:

- Once started, the challenge should be:
  - Removed from **Suggested Challenges**.
  - Shown in **Active Challenges**.
- Upon completion or failure, it should be removed from **Active** and moved to the corresponding tab.
- Progress bar should reflect the exact number of days completed successfully.

### ✅ Example Timeline:

| Date       | Expense Added | Result         | Status   |
|------------|---------------|----------------|----------|
| Apr 25     | ✅             | Day 1 complete | Active   |
| Apr 26     | ✅             | Day 2 complete | Active   |
| Apr 27     | ❌             | Challenge Fails| Failed   |

Please rewrite the logic to include:
- **Daily tracking with fail on first miss**
- **Accurate progress tracking**
- **Proper challenge state transitions**
